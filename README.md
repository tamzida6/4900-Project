# 4900-Project
4900 project description
For my 4900 project I plan to create a website for an organization that my supervisor has created called MWLDP(Muslim Womens Leadership Program). The website intends to show viewers what its like to be as a mulsim women in leadership and will allow people to connect with others and see where events will take place. A better description of the website and MWLDP will be added once I get more information from my supervisor. For managing any source code, I will just use HTML,css, and javascript and keep my code saved on VS code. Once I create my work flow for my website i will begin following those designs. There may be slight chnages to the designs throughout the project. for tracking revisions I will have a set date where i have myself and my supervisor revise (ex: every tuesday, or every 2 weeks). I am working individually so I did not use code style guidelines. The source code will go through reviews very frequently to ensure quality, maybe every 2 weeks.
