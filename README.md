# 4900-Project
4900 project description
For my 4900 project I plan to create a website for an organization that my supervisor has created called MWLDP(Muslim Womens Leadership Program). The Muslim Women's Leadership Development Project is an initiative at the Brooklyn College Womenâ€™s Center that seeks to provide representation for Muslim Women in different career fields, develop a mentorship network, & foster and maintain a community for Muslim students. The goal of our project is to develop meaningful events for Muslim women on the Brooklyn College Campus every semester and address their concerns from Islamaphobia to religious accommodations. The website intends to show viewers what its like to be as a mulsim women in leadership and will allow people to connect with others and see where events will take place. For managing any source code, I will just use HTML,css, and javascript and keep my code saved on VS code. Once I create my work flow for my website I will begin following those designs. There may be slight chnages to the designs throughout the project. for tracking revisions I will have a set date where I have myself and my supervisor revise (ex: every tuesday, or every 2 weeks). I am working individually so I did not use code style guidelines. The source code will go through reviews very frequently to ensure quality, maybe every 2 weeks.
