          Naheed, a native of Staten Island, began her undergraduate journey at
          Brooklyn College in 2018 as a Macaulay Honors program student.
          Intrigued by the college's diversity, she was drawn to engage with
          various communities. While initially undecided about her major, Naheed
          always harbored a passion for medicine. After taking anthropology
          courses, she found her calling in studying human beings and the
          systems shaping our experiences, leading her to pursue anthropology
          with a minor in chemistry on the pre-medical track.<br /><br />“I
          learned a lot as press director in terms of what student government is
          needed for,” she said, noting that many students checked USG’s
          announcements and socials for college-related updates. During her
          sophomore year, Naheed joined the student government as a senator,
          serving on the Student Affairs subcommittee. Recognizing the
          importance of student voices, especially during the pandemic, she
          worked tirelessly to advocate for her peers. As co-president, she
          collaborated with her partner to facilitate the transition back to
          in-person learning, addressing student concerns directly with
          administrators. Despite facing challenges as a woman of color and a
          Muslim woman in leadership, Naheed remained committed to representing
          her community and advocating for their needs.  <br /><br />
          “Being a woman of color and especially a Muslim woman on the Brooklyn
          College campus, holding the position I hold, was a complicated sort of
          experience. It required me to be very particular of everything that I
          do, every event that I choose to show up to, and every position that I
          hold or things that I say that I feel like probably wouldn’t have been
          the case if I had any other identity,” In her role as co-president,
          Naheed prioritized ensuring that Muslim student concerns were heard
          and addressed by the college administration, given the community's
          history of being surveilled by an undercover NYPD officer on campus.
          Despite the complexities of her identity and the challenges it posed,
          Naheed persevered in her leadership role, mindful of the importance of
          every decision and action she took. She will continue her advocacy
          work as the program coordinator for the Muslim Women's Research
          Development Project at The Women's Center.
